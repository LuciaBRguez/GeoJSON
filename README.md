### GeoJSON

##### This website shows the councils of the regions through which the “French Way” of the Camino de Santiago goes throw. This path has been chosen in the last phase of the route, that is, in the province of A Coruña.

For this, two different shps have crossed, one from councils and the other from provinces, both from Galicia.

The councils' shp has been filtered by the regions: Santiago, Arzúa, Terra De Melide, A Ulloa, Lugo, Sarria and Os Ancares.

The resulting shp has been crossed with the province of A Coruña.

Finally, the obtained shp has been converted to geoJSON and displayed using Leaflet. Where the filtered councils are represented as polygon and the name of the counties that contain them as a marker.
